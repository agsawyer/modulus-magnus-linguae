One of the main challenges that we had during this project was getting a text file version of the textbooks. This is because the PDFs are all scans that are difficult to OCR, as the Latin characters are often mistaken for other random numbers/letters by modern OCR systems.

We were able to find a website that had the text files, but only for one textbook, and it is now down. Thus, this project was an experimentation with trying to do the OCR ourselves. Overall, it worked alright but a Latin specific OCR likely would have performed much better.
